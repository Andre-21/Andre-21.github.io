                <h2>Problem Statement: Location Issue</h2>
            </a>
            <p>
                Many students struggle on a semesterly basis to successfully locate their classes resulting in tardiness
                and a content absorption disadvantage. Not only is locating the building in which the class is located a
                challenge, but finding the classroom itself is often a problem disregarded.
